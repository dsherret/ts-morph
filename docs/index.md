## Purpose

Setup, navigation, and manipulation of the TypeScript AST can be a challenge. This library wraps the TypeScript compiler API so it's simple.

## Installing

Install as usual via npm:

```
npm install --save-dev ts-morph
```

Or if you're using deno:

```ts
import { Project } from "https://deno.land/x/ts_morph/mod.ts";
```

## Documentation Progress

I've been still slowly updating the documentation. I'm keeping it up to date with any new features, but some existing features don't have documentation.
