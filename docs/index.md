## Purpose

Setup, navigation, and manipulation of the TypeScript AST can be a challenge. This library wraps the TypeScript compiler so it's simple.

## Installing

You must additionally install the correct TypeScript compiler version as specified in the library's peer dependencies.

```
npm install --save-dev typescript@2.5.3
npm install --save-dev ts-simple-ast
```

## Documentation Progress (Updated: 22 July 2017)

I've been still slowly updating the documentation. I'm keeping it up to date with any new features, but some existing features don't have documentation.
